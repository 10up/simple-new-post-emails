### Contributing

Pull requests and issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/10up/simple-new-post-emails) welcome.

## Installation

Simple New Post Emails is most easily installed automatically via the Plugins tab in your dashboard. If other WordPress emails do not send from your installation, neither will these.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where are all the configuration options?

The premise of this plugin is to keep things as simple as possible, particularly in the UI and UX. There are many other great plugins available that provide more functionality (typically with the cost of a more complex user experience), as well as email newsletter services. Some configuration is possible via hooks. If a hook isn't available to accomplish what you need, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/10up/simple-new-post-emails/issues).

## Support Level

**Active:** 10up is actively working on this, and we expect to continue work for the foreseeable future including keeping tested up to the most recent version of WordPress.  Bug reports, feature requests, questions, and pull requests are welcome.
