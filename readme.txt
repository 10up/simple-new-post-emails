== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are all the configuration options? =

The premise of this plugin is to keep things as simple as possible, particularly in the UI and UX. There are many other great plugins available that provide more functionality (typically with the cost of a more complex user experience), as well as email newsletter services. Some configuration is possible via hooks. If a hook isn't available to accomplish what you need, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/10up/simple-new-post-emails/issues).
